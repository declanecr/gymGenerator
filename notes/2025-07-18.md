## ✅ Goals
- [ ] 🔺 begin brainstorming/researching workout recommendation logic
- [ ] 🔺 ensure Jest functionality for Codex
- [ ] ⏫ implement copying template to workout
	- [ ] tests
- [ ] 🔽  create filters component (put in a custom hook)
	- [ ] 🔽 implement interfunctionality between them
- [ ] 🔽 upgrade schemas (add metadata)

## 🛠️ Work Done
- added schema tests for create and update workoutSchema 
- fixed `exercises.test.ts` so that it properly mirrors the exercises API functionality
- added auth and users test file
- added integration tests for the zod schemas in the frontend:
	- Resetting mocks before each form test ensures isolated assertions on API calls
	- Added a new test verifying that short passwords show an error in the login form
	- Added a similar password length test for the register form
	- Validated that blank workout names prevent submission in template workouts
	- Checked the same blank-name behavior in workout containers
- added tests for fetch hooks
- added tests for createWorkoutFromTemplate in backend:
	- user edits template -> saves to new user template
	- user edits template -> start this workout -> NO
	- user edits template -> start this workout -> YES
