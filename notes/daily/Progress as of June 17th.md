# Progress Overview – Gym Tracker Project

---

## **Core Stack**

- **Frontend:** React, Material UI, React Hook Form + Zod, Zustand/Context API
    
- **Backend:** NestJS, Prisma, Node.js, SQLite (dev)
    
- **API Calls:** Axios, React Query v5
    
- **Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library, MSW
    

---

## **Major Progress So Far**

### **1. Backend/Database**

- **Schema/Prisma:**
    
    - Workouts, Exercises, Sets models created.
        
    - Migrations & seed data working.
        
- **API Endpoints:**
    
    - CRUD endpoints for Workouts, Exercises, Sets implemented or scaffolded.
        

---

### **2. Frontend Structure**

- **Component Tiers:**
    
    - WorkoutContainer/Form
        
    - ExerciseContainer/Form
        
    - SetContainer/Form
        
- **Forms:**
    
    - React Hook Form + Zod validation for each entity (partial/minimal so far).
        

---

### **3. React Query Data Layer**

- **Query Hooks:**
    
    - `useWorkouts`, `useExercises`, `useSets` — fetch lists.
        
    - `useGetWorkout` — fetch single workout by id.
        
- **Mutation Hooks:**
    
    - `useCreateWorkout`, `useUpdateWorkout`, etc. for each entity.
        
    - Invalidate relevant queries on mutation.
        

---

### **4. Testing**

- API and hook-level tests passing for current CRUD endpoints.
    
- Initial test suites: `workouts.test.ts`, `exercises.test.ts`, `sets.test.ts`
    

---

### **5. Component Integration**

- **Data passed down via props; forms display initial values for edit mode.**
    
- **Containers handle mutations** (forms only display/collect data).
    
- **Exercise & Set forms are nested under their respective parents.**
    
- **User can edit all workout fields except status.**
    
- **Set completion logic:** only completed sets are submitted.
    

---

## **Known Issues / In-Progress**

- Error boundary handling & user feedback (snackbar, etc.) needs polish.
    
- Not all hooks/components are type-complete; some `any` usage remains.
    
- Not all queries/mutations have corresponding hooks.
    
- Full validation rules (with user-friendly errors) not fully wired for all forms.
    

---

## **Next Steps**

1. Add robust form validation and error handling (starting with Workout).
    
2. Polish user feedback/UI and test more complex flows.
