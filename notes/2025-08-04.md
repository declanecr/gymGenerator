## 🛠️ Work Done
- met with Caleb and took notes on CI
- added progress bar button to Dashboard layout
- added progress by volume over time chart to progress page

## 🧠 Learnings / Notes
- next CI step is deployment
	- can do that in a GHA (github action)
- Post Deployment validation
	- have a few checks that run to check endpoints and such
- next is rollbacks
	- if you deploy somehting and it fails , how do you undeploy and redploy previous artifact
- being able to that automated (that's hard to do)
- SYSTEM DESIGN
	- big database would be accessed via something like "reddis" which actually accesses database and caches to prevent having to go all the way through ot the databse again
		- Axios may have caching options
- LOAD TESTING - using tons of fake users to see if app can handle it
	- SCALING - configure at what point does your app scale up or down based on number of users
- PRODUCTIONALIZATION - getting ready for PROD
