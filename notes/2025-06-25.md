## 🛠️ Work Done
- reverted back to CommonJS because of error with seed.ts file/
- created useExercisesCatalog hook\
	- implemented globally available exercise catalog selection and submission into frontend
	- implemented custom exercise viewing based on user id
- turned off auto testing by ensuring "--watch" is not included in my test script
- added `--skip-seed` to `./backend/package.json` test script to prevent tests from running on dev DB, because they kept using the dev DB even though i didn't want them to
