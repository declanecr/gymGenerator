## ðŸ’¡ **What Is Dependency Injection (DI)?**

**Dependency Injection** is a design pattern where a class **doesn't create its own dependencies** â€” instead, they are **provided (injected)** by some external system (like a framework or container).

This promotes:
- **Loose coupling**
- **Easier testing**
- **Cleaner, more maintainable code**

## ðŸ”§ Real-world Analogy

Imagine a coffee machine that needs **water** and **beans**.

### Without DI (Hardcoded dependencies):
``` ts
class CoffeeMachine {
  private water = new Water();  // tightly coupled
  private beans = new Beans();
}
```
Now you canâ€™t easily test it with different water or mock beans.
### With DI:
``` ts
class CoffeeMachine {
  constructor(private water: Water, private beans: Beans) {}
}
```
Now you can inject different water or bean types â€” or mock them entirely in tests.

## ðŸ§± In NestJS

Nest uses **a built-in DI container** to manage and inject dependencies.
### Example:
``` ts 
@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  constructor(private prisma: PrismaService) {}
}
```
You donâ€™t create `PrismaService` manually â€” Nest handles that.
##### NOTE:
- `PrismaService` is the injectable in this examples
- `UsersService` is __also__ being made as an Injectable
### How it works:

- You mark classes with `@Injectable()`
- Nest registers them as **providers**
- When another class needs them, Nest automatically creates and injects the instance

## âœ… Benefits of DI
| Benefit                  | Why it matters                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decoupling**           | Classes don't depend on specific implementations              |
| **Testing**              | You can easily inject mocks or stubs                          |
| **Reusability**          | Replace or reuse dependencies in different contexts           |
| **Inversion of Control** | Classes don't control their dependencies â€” the framework does |
