## 🧰 `zod`

### ➤ What it is:

A **TypeScript-first schema validation library**. Think of it like Yup, but built from the ground up for TS.

### ➤ Why it's useful:

- **Schema-first validation** — you define exactly what data is valid.
    
- **Type inference** — no need to define separate interfaces.
    
- **Chainable + composable** — readable, modular logic.
    

### ➤ How it works:

You define a Zod schema like this:
```ts
const loginSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
});
```

> [!question]+ ## ✅ Why use [[Zod]] and [[React-Hook-Form]] _together_?
> Using RHF with Zod gives you:- Great performance (RHF)
   > 
> - Strong, type-safe validation (Zod)
>    
> - Clean, centralized form logic
 >   
>- Easy error display and API submission handling

## Valid Form submission schema
#### when interworking Zod with [[React-Hook-Form|RHF]], it is important to validate the submission to ensure it aligns with the established schema. 
#### These are the OPERATORS used and their explanations


1. **`?.` Optional chaining**
    
    ```ts
    errors.exercises?.[idx]?.sets?.message
    ```
    
    - If any step (`exercises`, `[idx]`, or `sets`) is `null` or `undefined`, the whole expression immediately yields `undefined` instead of throwing.
        
    - Great for safely digging into deeply nested objects when you’re not 100% sure every level exists.
        
2. **`!` Non-null assertion (TypeScript)**
    
    ```ts
    errors.exercises![idx].sets!.message
    ```
    
    - Tells the TS compiler “Trust me, this isn’t `null` or `undefined` here.”
        
    - Used when you know (by logic or by the guard you’ve written) that the value must be present, but the compiler can’t prove it on its own.
        
3. **`!!` Double-bang Boolean coercion**
    
    ```ts
    !!errors.exercises?.[idx]?.sets?.message
    ```
    
    - First `!` turns any value into its Boolean opposite (`undefined` → `true`, non-empty string → `false`), second `!` flips it back to the real Boolean (`undefined` → `false`, non-empty string → `true`).
        
    - Handy when you need a strict `true`/`false` (e.g. in a conditional) rather than a truthy/falsy value.
        
4. **`?` Optional properties/parameters in types**
    
    ```ts
    interface ExerciseFormValues {
      id?: string      // may be absent
      notes?: string   // may be omitted
    }
    ```
    
    - In a **type/interface**, a `?` on the _declaration_ side means that property or parameter is optional.
        
5. **`mode: 'onSubmit'` and `reValidateMode: 'onSubmit'`**
    
    ```ts
    useForm({ mode: 'onSubmit', reValidateMode: 'onSubmit' })
    ```
    
    - Not a punctuation mark, but often paired with the above to say “only run validation (and populate `errors`) when the user clicks Submit, not on every change.”

### Putting it all together

When you write:

```ts
{submitCount > 0 && !!errors.exercises?.[i]?.sets?.message && (
  <FormHelperText>{errors.exercises[i].sets!.message}</FormHelperText>
)}
```

you’re saying:

1. **`submitCount > 0`** → only after at least one submit
    
2. **`!!…message`** → ensure we’ve got an actual error string (truthy)
    
3. **`?.`** → safely check deep into the nested `errors` object
    
4. **`sets!.message`** → once we know it’s there, convince TS it really is
    

Together, these little symbols let you write concise, safe, and correctly-typed guards for rendering exactly the errors you want, exactly when you want them.
