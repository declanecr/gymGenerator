## üß∞ `react-hook-form` (RHF)

### ‚û§ What it is:

A lightweight form library for React that **minimizes re-renders** and gives you easy access to form state (like `isDirty`, `errors`, `isSubmitting`, etc).

### ‚û§ Why it's useful:

- **Very performant**: minimal re-renders, even with big forms.
    
- **Clean API**: uses `register`, `handleSubmit`, `watch`, etc.
    
- **Great dev experience**: easy to use, easy to debug.
    

### ‚û§ How it works:

You ‚Äúregister‚Äù each form input with RHF, which tracks and validates it internally. You pass `handleSubmit(onSubmit)` to your `<form>`.

## üß∞ `@hookform/resolvers`

### ‚û§ What it is:

A bridge between `react-hook-form` and validation libraries like Zod.

### ‚û§ Why it's useful:

- Makes Zod (or Yup, Joi, etc.) usable with RHF in one line.
    
- Centralizes validation logic.
    
- Lets you display field errors easily via RHF.

> [!question]+ ## ‚úÖ Why use [[Zod]] and [[React-Hook-Form]] _together_?
> Using RHF with Zod gives you:- Great performance (RHF)
   > 
> - Strong, type-safe validation (Zod)
>    
> - Clean, centralized form logic
 >   
>- Easy error display and API submission handling

# useForm
**Definition**  
`useForm` initializes React Hook Form‚Äôs state and returns helpers for registration, validation, and submission, optionally wired to a Zod schema via a resolver.

```tsx
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod';
import { workoutSchema, WorkoutFormValues } from '../schemas/workout';

const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm<WorkoutFormValues>({
  resolver: zodResolver(workoutSchema),
  defaultValues: { name: '', sets: [] },
});
```

    participant U as User
    participant C as Component
    participant RHF as useForm
    U->>C: fill inputs
    C->>RHF: register()
    RHF-->>C: track value & errors
    C->>C: handleSubmit(onSubmit)  
```
